pHaRos 180&deg;
=========

pHaRos 180&deg; is a cloud-enabled Human Resources competency evaluation manager.

  - Developed using Ruby on Rails
  - Uses the Flatty Bootstrap theme
  - Open Source
  - Uses Google Sign-in for authentication

pHaRos 180&deg; was idealized and developed by the [Bionexo] Technology team to help the Human Resources department to evolve their competency evaluation program, as they write:

> The main idea here was to promote a hackaton to train the developers with the RoR environment, with something actually useful for the company which used to do the competency evaluation program manually and with basic spreadsheets.
> The conclusion of this hackaton is a team with new RoR skills, a Human Resource department with a brand new system to carry out the company evaluation and a new open source software to the world!
